# Python-Code-Challenge2

This challenge defines a basic restaurant review system that allows users to create customers, restaurants, and reviews.

## Classes

The Review class represents a customer review for a specific restaurant. It stores details like the customer, the restaurant being reviewed, and the rating given. Each review is automatically added to a static list called all_reviews.

The Customer class represents a customer who can write reviews for restaurants. It tracks customer information and interactions. Each customer instance is added to the all_customers static list.

The Restaurant class represents a restaurant and its associated information. It maintains a list of reviews and customers related to the restaurant. All restaurant instances are added to the all_restaurants static list.
